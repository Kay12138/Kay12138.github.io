			<p><b>Where am I? </b> <br>I&#8217m now in NYU summer session studying website design.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Where do I wanna go?</b> <br>A field that no one have being there before. </p>
				<br>
			<p><b>My favorite subject?</b><br>Now, it is psychology. I am really interested into it, cuz it seems to be very cool and useful in the future. But I haven&#8217t try it in a very serious way, so I am not sure will it be a life-time interest.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Do I like FOOOOOOD?</b> <br>Yes! Very much! Especially the ones that contains high calorie, but I also have high request to their taste. When I am stressed out, I will start to eat a lot of things! Usually the salty ones like biscuit and chip.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Do I believe in ET?</b> <br>YEEEEEEEES! There are pictures that Russia took in space contaning flying luminous body which shape is very similar to human. Also there is a saying that when Apollo got to the moon, he represents US to leave something in the space used to contact with ET. Because there was a large period of time that astronaut was not in the sight of camera, and no one knows what was he doing.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Where is the place I want to travel to the most? </b><br>I want to go to the South Pole.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Do I want to have a sister?</b> <br>Yes. Elder one would be better, since the younger sister will definitely be annoying.</p>
				<br>
			<p><b>Do I want to keep a pet? </b><br>Yeah. Animals are cute.</p>
